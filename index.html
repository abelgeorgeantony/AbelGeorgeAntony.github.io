				<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>
					I am <i>Abel George Antony</i>, just a <u>thinker</u>.
					From a young age I've been fascinated by technology.
					This interest led me down the path to choose computer science in 11th standard which in turn opened
					the
					world of programming, where I've discovered a realm of
					endless possibilities.

					I am not currently an expert in any domains, but after
					learning the basics of programming I have become
					confident that I can learn pretty much any technology from scratch.

							Life before programming
						</div>
						<div class="wpcontent" id="wpcontent1">
							I was born on the twenty-second of April, two-thousand five in Kerala, India. 
							It is very hard for me to recall the past(people mock me by saying I have alzheimers!).
							I went to Georgian public school till 2nd standard and moved to trivandrum for my
							father's professional needs. There I joined [school name]. I attended a total of one 
							academical hour in that school that's when my mother got me out of the school! My father 
							had met with an accident and on our way to meet him in the hospital he passed away. After
							that because there was nobody to look after us in trivandrum we went to live with my 
							mother's brother in bangalore. There I completed 3rd standard and came back to kerala 
							to live with my father's family. I attended Georgian public school till 7th standard and
							joined St. Aloysius in 8th standard. In 2021 I passed SSLC with 93% in terms of grades.
							Higher Secondary was available in the same school, So I joined for computer science
							there.

							My journey as a programmer began in 11th standard when I had no prior knowledge
							 of programming and limited understanding of computers. However, I was always 
							 fascinated by technology, which led me to choose the computer science stream in 
							 school. Around the same time, I stumbled upon an advertisement in a video for the 
							 100k coding challenge by the channel Brototype (previously known as Crossroads). 
							 Intrigued by the idea, I watched the first video and signed up for the challenge. 
							 Unfortunately, without access to a computer and lacking discipline, I didn't make 
							 much progress at that time. However, my determination to learn programming led me 
							 to discover a mobile application called Termux. I started using it to learn and run 
							 C programs from the 100k challenge. This mobile app provided me with a platform to 
							 practice coding even without a computer. As time went on, I faced a roadblock in my 
							 progress with the 100k challenge. The challenge began focusing on teaching Java and 
							 its Swing library, which required a computer. Since I didn't have one, I felt stuck and unable to proceed. Despite the setback, I refused to give up. Instead, I started experimenting on my own by writing terminal-level applications in C++. One of my proudest creations during this time was a program that printed a yearly calendar. Eventually, I gained access to my uncle's old desktop computer, which had Windows 7 installed on it, although it was slowly becoming obsolete. Despite the challenges, I persevered and eventually completed the 100k challenge. I continued my self-guided learning journey by exploring topics on the internet, often staying ahead of or in sync with the teachings in my school's computer classes. During computer lab sessions, I found joy in helping my fellow students when they encountered errors or needed explanations of concepts, especially during exam preparation. 
							 This experience made me feel like an expert in computers and programming to my peers. However, it is important to note that while I excelled in programming, my academic grades did not reflect my expertise.

							Second steps

						<div class="wpcontent" id="wpcontent3">
							<!--In 11th grade, I achieved a total score of 53%, and in 12th grade, I scored 69%. 
							Despite societal expectations and pressure to excel academically, my family was 
							surprised that I even passed, as I hadn't studied diligently except during exam 
							time. Acknowledging my grades, I accepted the reality that my academic performance 
							did not align with my passion for programming. My original plan was to attend 
							Brocamp, a coding camp run by Brototype, but my family did not support non-degree 
							learning. As a compromise, I decided to pursue a Bachelor of Computer Applications 
							(BCA) degree, which aligned with my interests, although it still involved subjects 
							like mathematics and English. However, my family pressured me to study in Ernakulam, 
							so I began applying online for colleges. I ambitiously applied to a college called Rajagiri 
							and even attended an interview. Another college I considered was Sacred Heart, where 
							I went in person to ask for admission but faced rejection due to my low grades. 
							They claimed that BCA was challenging even for students with high grades, implying 
							that my aspiration was foolishness. I also applied to Bharat Mata College of Commerce 
							and Arts (BMCCA), and although they initially discouraged me due to my marks, they 
							eventually offered me admission. Despite being a smaller college compared to the others, 
							BMCCA provided a peaceful environment, which I considered a win under the circumstances.
