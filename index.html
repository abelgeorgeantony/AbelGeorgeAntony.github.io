				<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>
					I'm Abel George Antony—just an ordinary guy who likes tech. 
					I chose computer science in 11th grade, which opened the door to programming and a world of 
					endless options. Though I'm not an expert yet, I'm confident that I can learn any tech from 
					scratch. I love turning ideas into code and solving challenges. My belief in constant 
					learning keeps me going, and projects are where I put theory into practice. I believe every 
					line of code I write is a step toward innovation. There's so much to explore, and I'm 
					excited for the journey ahead.

							I was born on the twenty-second of April, two-thousand five in Kerala, India. 
							It is very hard for me to recall the past(people mock me by saying I have alzheimers!).
							I went to Georgian public school till 2nd standard and moved to trivandrum for my
							father's professional needs. There I joined [school name]. I attended a total of one 
							academical hour in that school that's when my mother got me out of the school! My father 
							had met with an accident and on our way to meet him in the hospital he passed away. After
							that because there was nobody to look after us in trivandrum we went to live with my 
							mother's brother in bangalore. There I completed 3rd standard and came back to kerala 
							to live with my father's family. I attended Georgian public school till 7th standard and
							joined St. Aloysius in 8th standard. In 2021 I passed SSLC with 93% in terms of grades.
							Higher Secondary was available in the same school, So I joined for computer science
							there.

							My journey as a programmer began in 11th grade when I had no prior knowledge
							 of programming and limited understanding of computers. However, I was always 
							 fascinated by technology, which led me to choose the computer science stream in 
							 school. Around the same time, I stumbled upon an advertisement in a video for the 
							 100k coding challenge by the channel Brototype (previously known as Crossroads). 
							 Intrigued by the video, I watched the intro and signed up for the challenge. 
							 Unfortunately, due to my lacking discipline and without access to a computer, I didn't 
							 make much progress at that time. However, my determination to learn programming led me 
							 to discover a mobile application called Termux. I started using it to learn and run 
							 C programs from the 100k challenge. This mobile app provided me with a platform to 
							 practice coding even without a computer. As time went on, I faced a roadblock in my 
							 progress with the 100k challenge. The challenge began focusing on teaching Java and 
							 its Swing library, which required a computer. Since I didn't have one, I felt stuck 
							 and unable to proceed. Despite the setback, I refused to give up. Instead, I started 
							 experimenting on my own by writing terminal-level applications in C++. One of my 
							 proudest creations during this time was a program that printed a yearly calendar. 
							 Eventually, I gained access to my uncle's old desktop computer, which had Windows 7 
							 installed on it, although it was slowly becoming obsolete. Despite the challenges, I 
							 persevered and eventually completed the 100k challenge. I continued my self-guided 
							 learning journey by exploring topics on the internet, often staying ahead of or in 
							 sync with the teachings in my school's computer classes. During computer lab sessions, 
							 I found joy in helping my fellow students when they encountered errors or needed 
							 explanations of concepts, especially during exam preparation. This experience made me 
							 feel like an expert in computers and programming to my peers. However, it is important 
							 to note that while I excelled in programming, my academic grades did not reflect my 
							 expertise.

							In my 11th-grade, I achieved a total score of 53%. 
								The following year, in 12th grade, my score improved to 69%. 
								Despite the societal pressure and expectations to excel academically,
								 my family's surprise at my passing grades was evident. I hadn't been 
								 a diligent student except during exams. Recognizing my academic 
								 performance, I came to terms with the misalignment between my 
								 grades and my programming passion. Initially planning to enroll in a 
								 coding camp, my family disagreed with non-degree learning. As a 
								 compromise, I opted for a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) 
								 degree that resonated with my interests, albeit involving subjects 
								 like mathematics and English. Family pressure led me to apply online 
								 for colleges, ambitiously seeking admission to several. One of these 
								 institutions conducted an interview and ghosted me, while another rejected me based 
								 on my low grades, suggesting the challenging nature of BCA made my aspiration 
								 impractical. Despite initial discouragement due to my marks, Bharat Mata College of 
								 Commerce and Arts (BMCCA) eventually granted me admission. Although smaller, BMCCA's 
								 peaceful environment felt like a victory considering the circumstances.
